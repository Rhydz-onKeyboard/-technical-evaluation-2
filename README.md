# Top five most contracted insurances.

### This algorithm returns the list of the five most contracted insurance ordered from highest to lowest.

## How does it work?

    - Main.js creates a new class instance and calls the getMostHiredInsuranceLast24Hrs method.
    - Internally the method obtains the data of the company's services.
    - It also manipulates the data to obtain the repeated elements, order them to generate the top five and cross the list to generate the search in the insurance list.
    - Finally, it shows by console the five most contracted insurances.


## Installation instructions.

You will need install dependencies with `npm i`.

## Usage.

Run `node main.js` to get the top five insurance list.
